# Advent of Code

All of my attempts at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges:

- 2024 - [WebDSL](https://webdsl.org/)
- 2023 - [WebDSL](https://webdsl.org/)
- 2022 - Rust until I gave up and used Python instead
- 2021 - Python

## Word of Caution

Do not use these as inspiration please. There are better resources out there and my implementations are most likely terrible.
